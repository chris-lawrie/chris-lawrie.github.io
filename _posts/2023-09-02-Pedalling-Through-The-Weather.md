👷‍♂️🚧....blog in progress!... 🚧👷‍♂️

I've lived in New York City for the last year or so, and have citibiked my way around for most of that time. With enough frequency that it is annoying, I'll find my local stations devoid of bikes to unlock, or attempt to return my trusty steed to a station already bursting at the seams.

I am interested in exploring how bike usage tracks with the weather in the city, and if I might be better able to predict when there may be limited bikes/parking spots at my most frequented stations.

Citibike provides all their historical ride data, for free, [here](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) (way to go citibike!). To start this analysis let's load and explore some of thes data. We will analyse all the rides that took place in 2022.

Test extra line..
