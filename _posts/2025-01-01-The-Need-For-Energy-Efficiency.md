title: The Problem With Energy Efficiency Retrofits
summary: How to deploy energy efficiency retrofits effectively in the US
---

👷‍♂️🚧....post in progress!... 🚧👷‍♂️

Key points:
- There is a desperate need for energy efficiency upgrades (70% of electricity consumption, very old building stock)
- There are a mix of incentives (landlords are not responsible for electric bills, tennants don't see benefit of something with a multi-year payback period).
- There is a lot of federal, state and utility funding floating around
- Lots of companies have tried (and failed) to make money at providing EE retrofits (e.g BlocPower, Carbonlight house)
- We need to bring stakeholders together & give them a single pane of glass through which to solve this problem
